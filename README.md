# Improving Structural Plausibility in 3D Molecule Generation via Property-Conditioned Training with Distorted Molecules

This repository contains code for the paper "Improving Structural Plausibility in 3D Molecule Generation via Property-Conditioned Training with Distorted Molecules" (preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.17.613136v1))
. In this work, we propose a novel method to enhance the structural plausibility of molecules generated by machine learning models, particularly diffusion models. Our approach conditions models on conformer quality, allowing for more valid and reliable molecule generation, a critical task in computational drug design.
